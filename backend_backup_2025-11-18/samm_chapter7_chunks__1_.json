The purchaser may, for logistics reasons, request that the procurement be made from a Continental United States (CONUS) source. The IA will notify the Procurement Agency of the purchaser's decision. If procurement is from an offshore vendor, the DoD Contract Administrator must send a Notice of Availability (Defense Department (DD) Form 1348-5) to either the Offshore NOA address identified for the purchaser in the applicable Military Assistance Program Address Directory (MAPAD) or, if none is listed, to the appropriate NOA address listed for the applicable MAPAD. Based on the NOA, the purchaser or its Foreign Military Sales (FMS) freight forwarder may direct movement of the materiel to an offshore facility in the same region as the materiel's origin or to the FMS freight forwarder's facility in CONUS. The purchaser is responsible for the cost of movement to the CONUS FMS freight forwarder and for all export and/or import licenses and Customs clearance requirements imposed by the materiel's country of origin and the USG. Regardless of what procedure is followed, title passes to the purchaser at the shipment's point of origin, See Chapter 15. for certain exceptions, and Chapter 9 for further information on Offshore Procurement. The DoD CONUS contractor who was awarded the original FMS contract is responsible if they purchase the items offshore at an OCONUS subcontractor's facility since this will change the original plans for transportation and DoD contract that was awarded. The primary DoD contractor then becomes responsible to move the freight from the subcontractor's facility to the ultimate destination at no cost to the USG or the FMS customer. Others NOA C7.19.1.
