For Letters of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) with Anticipated Offer Dates (AODs) relative to groups B, C, and D (see Section C5.T6.), a delay in receiving contractor estimates may adversely affect the MILDEPs ability to offer LOAs in a timely manner. When developing an LOA document that requires a vendor estimate, the standard timeframe to wait for the vendor estimate is 20 days from the date of the MILDEP request. Absent the vendor estimate, the MILDEP should develop the estimate of the item(s) cost using the mechanisms identified in the DoD FMR Vol 15, Ch 7. This timeframe is not a \"hard-stop\" and the MILDEP may, at its discretion, allow for a longer time for a vendor response when warranted by the circumstances (e.g., first sale of an item, more unique/complicated version, non-standard or country-unique requirements, etc. where the MILDEP would be unable to develop a reasonably accurate estimate.)
